# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To provide an anaylsis breakdown of a dataset on kickstarter campaigns to best understand how Louise's campaign compared to other kickstarter campaigns when looking at their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Purpose
Louise would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. By doing so, we may be able to create a "formula" for insuring a high chance of success in kickstarter campaigns for the category "Theatre".

## Analysis and Challenges
What you will be seeing in this portion of the report will be some charts and graphs that we have created for you. The charts and graphs you see will help you better understand the information we are trying to convey. We also thought it would be nice to show you guys some of the challenges and difficulties we encountered during this little project so you guys can see a glimpse of what all goes on underneath the hood of making this possible.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 What we have here is a chart that shows three different categories of theatre. Successful, failed, and canceled. As we look at the line chart we can see that there is a huge increase of successful theatre campaigns between the months of March and August. In other words - success is much more probable during spring/summer time. We also see a slight increase in failed theatres during those periods but that comes with the nature of there being more attempts in launching a successful theatre. We could discuss the canceled category but it really doesn't offer much input here. Pretty consistent across the board through out the year.
